# Description  
Munir-PDF is a web-based PDF reader and text analysis tool integrated into the Munir-GPT website. Its primary function is to allow users to upload PDF files, extract text content from those PDFs, and then provide various functionalities for processing and interacting with the extracted text.

# Information  
This is the AI PDF-Reader for my Munir-GPT website. The backend was coded in Python and used Axios.jS to connect the server side to the client side.
